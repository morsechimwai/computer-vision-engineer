# Computer Vision Engineer

A collection of code and learning materials for studying and revising **Computer Vision**.  
Designed for those who want to practice the fundamentals and experiment with popular tools and frameworks.

#### Foundation

- [Basic Image Processing](./notebooks/image-processing.ipynb)
- [Linear Algebra / Matrix Ops](./notebooks/linear-algebra-matrix-ops.ipynb)

#### Core CV Models

- [Classic CV](./notebooks/classic-cv.ipynb)
- CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- - [Basic Deep Learning with ðŸ”¥Pytorch](./notebooks/basic-pytorch-dl.ipynb)
- - [LeNet-5](./notebooks/cnn-lenet-5.ipynb)
- - [AlexNet](./notebooks/cnn-alexnet.ipynb)
- - [VGG-16](./notebooks/cnn-vgg-16.ipynb)
- - [ResNet-18](./notebooks/cnn-resnet-18.ipynb)
- - [EfficientNet-B0](./notebooks/cnn-efficientnet-b0.ipynb)
- [Transfer Learning](./notebooks/transfer-learning.ipynb)

> PS. Each model was tested only on the CIFAR-100 dataset because it can be easily loaded from Torch, has a manageable data size, and includes a reasonable number of classes for experimentation.
